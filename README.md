MeshLabJS
=========

A javascript, client-side, mesh processing tool. Inspired by the well known [MeshLab](http://www.meshlab.net), [MeshLabJS](http://www.meshlabjs.net) is built using, for all the mesh processing tasks, the c++ [vcg library](http://vcg.sourceforge.net)  compiled into asm.js using [emscripten](http://emscripten.org) and it relies on [three.js](http://threejs.org/) for rendering. [MeshLabJS](http://www.meshlabjs.net) is developed by the [Visual Computing Lab](vcg.isti.cnr.it) of [ISTI - CNR](www.isti.cnr.it) and by the students of the FGT course.

Some more info on the code are in the [Documentation Page](http://www.meshlabjs.net/doc/html/).
Issues and bugs can be filed in the github [issue](https://github.com/cnr-isti-vclab/meshlabjs/issues) page.
