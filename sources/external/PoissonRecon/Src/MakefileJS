# A few notes on the options:
#
# -s PRECISE_F32=1 is needed because of a strange bug involving the assignments 
#           of floats. Actually asm.js uses doubles for most computation, 
#           this flags ensure a behavoiur more similar to the expected one.
# --bind    needed for exporting the functions from cpp to js.
# -s DEMANGLE_SUPPORT=1 More consistent naming of the cpp functions is preserved 
#           in asm.js. Useful for cpp stacktrace inside the browser.
